# Flask Docker Example

This project demonstrates how to containerize a Flask application with Docker, manage services with Docker Compose, and interact with a PostgreSQL database. It's ideal for learning the basics of Docker deployment with a Flask application.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get this Flask application running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) (optional, for API testing)

### Installation

Execute the following steps to set up the project environment:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BasharAZ1/flask_docker_example
   ```

2. **Start the Application with Docker Compose**

   Change to the project directory and launch the application services:

   ```bash
   cd flask_docker_example
   docker-compose up
   ```

3. **Set Up the Database**

   After the services are running, initialize the database with:

   ```bash
   docker run -it --network flask_kinan_default postgres psql -h flask_kinan-postgress_server-1 -U postgres
   ```

   When prompted, enter the password: `start123`

4. **Create the Database and Users Table**

   In the PostgreSQL CLI, create your database and table by running:

   ```sql
   create database usersdb;
   \connect usersdb;
   CREATE TABLE users (
       id     integer PRIMARY KEY GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
       name   varchar(40)
   );
   ```

5. **Adding Users with Postman**

   You can now use Postman to add users to your database. Configure Postman to send a POST request to the endpoint that handles user creation. Make sure to include the user data in the request body as JSON.
send POST request with"/users" and json file with "name":yourname
